# Milestone 4 - Design - Shane Loewe

Setup the initial web hosting for the project.


## What I did for Milestone 4

### Refined navigation flow of website

With the help of generative AI through ChatGPT I was able to display login and sign up buttons to users not in the system, and then
display project and profile buttons on the home page as well as a welcome back message if the user is in the system and logged in. 

### Added Logout functionality

I also added a logout button to the Profile page.
In that same vein I added LogInMixInRequired tags to the profile and projects view, so that you could only view your profile if you 
were logged in, which prevented issues like being able to logout of a profile you're not logged into repeatedly. 
Generally, this made the website more intuitive to use.

### "Refactored" Code

I know that the overall goal of the design role this week was to refactor the code, but our team has been pretty tight in 
maintaining a consistent coding style, so going back and restructuring things was not something that was super pertinent.
This is the reason I put "refactoring" in quotes, as I did go back and change some things, about the code, but much of it was as I
described earlier; simply going through the actual core functionality of our application and adding quality-of-life fixes to them.

## What I will do for Milestone 5

* For Milestone 5, I will be back in the coding role, and I intend on working on the Calendar functionality, and hopefully
getting it off the ground. That'll be my main focus, and I suspect that will take most of the Milestone. If I get around to it I may
try to work on some other backlog items, but I think I'll leave smaller coding tasks to my team-members so I don't step on their toes.

## Concerns and Challenges
My main concern with getting the calendar working is honestly just wrestling with CSS. I've looked a little online and was able to find
some solutions using unordered lists and lists in html. We'll see how it pans out. But then getting the task to display on that day feels like
it could be quite challenging (I'm thinking specifically of the way Canvas does their task calendar.)
