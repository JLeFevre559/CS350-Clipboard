## Milestone 4 - Design - Shane Loewe

* What did I do?
    * I used ChatGPT to generate a sample profile page
    * I used ChatGPT to clarify conditionals in HTML
    * I refined the navigation flow of the website
    * I added a Logout functionality
    * I added QoL changes to the website that make the UX better

* What will I do? 
    * For Milestone 5, I will be in the coding role and I will try to at least get a start on the Calendar functionality of the application
    * I will work with my team members to iron out bugs that we may run into
    * I will work on maintaining visual consistency in new views 
    * I will try to keep new code consistent with our standards

* What challenges do I have?
    * I ran into some issues with certain libraries not importing properly, and that took a day or so to figure out, so I was 
    prevented from pushing code or running the live development server for a minute. Hopefully those issues are behind me.
    * I intend on the Calendar being challenging to create, but I think with all of our minds on the task, I should be able to get
    it to a good place by the end of Milestone 5. 

* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 16 hours on Design for Milestone 4
    * Our team met for 4 hours throughout the week

* 5-minute Video Demo
