## Milestone 7 - Requirements - Shane Loewe

* What did I do?
    * Checked GitHub for outstanding issues
    * Identified 3 problems
    * Asked ChatGPT for ways to fix the issues we faced
    * Ranked the issues in order of highest concern
    * Planned how to enhance existing features
    * Planned implementing a new feature--the help page.

* What will I do? 
    * This is the last milestone and we will stop working on the project after this week.

* What challenges do I have?
    * None currently. Requirements gathering this late in the process was strange, but it makes sense,
    * I guess I hadn't done requirements in 4 weeks, so I sort of forgot we have to do this for each sprint
    * but it was a good reminder of the SDLC.

* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 12 hours on Requirements for Milestone 6
    * Our team met for 4 hours

* 5-minute Video Demo
