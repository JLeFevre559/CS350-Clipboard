# My 1.1 Release Contribution
So what I did specifically for the 1.1 update release was in line with what was expected I did a security audit in addition to engineering investment and devops documentation. 
* Refactoring some design elements.
* Bug fixing as it relates to the calendarâ€”implementataion.
* Some late features into the calendar specifically such as tasks being filtered by year.

Although because of the other aspects of my role, my coding was not a particular focus for this milestone, Although it should be mentioned that I did do some upgrades.
