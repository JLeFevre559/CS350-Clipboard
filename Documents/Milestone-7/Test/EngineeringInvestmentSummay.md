### Methodology for Data Collection
- Went through each of the milestones and add them together to find the total time investment and asked for the financial investment of our commercial product usage.

### Time Investments
-  Project Duration : The time frame given was between 8/14/2023 to 12/1/2023 roughly 15 weeks
- Requirements Man-Hours : 60 Hours
- Design Man-Hours : 72 Hours
- Code Man-Hours : 93 Hours
- Test Man-Hours : 69 Hours
- Team Meetup Man-Hours : 37.5 Hours
- Total Man-Hours : 304 for all roles. for all work done 341.5 Hours

### Financial Investments
- Cost of Materials
    It should be noted that all of the commercial products that we used have a cost of zero dollars for a limited use, primary for education, or first time users.
    As such many of the software we used to host the website, the database, and AI tools were extremely cheap to the point of costing zero dollars for the limited versions that we used.

- Equipment Expenses
    - Vercel - $0
    - MongoDB - $0
    - Django - $0
    - Copilot - $0
    - ChatGPT 3.5 - $0

- Labor Costs
    - Low End : $36 * 304~341.5 Hours = $10,944.00 ~ $12,294.00
    - Average End : $57 * 304~341.5 Hours = $17,328.00 ~ $19,465.50
    - High End : $93 * 304~341.5 Hours = $28,272.00 ~ $31,759.50

### Summary of Findings
- These findings highlight both the meticulous breakdown of time investments across project phases and the minimal financial impact incurred due to leveraging      zero-cost versions of commercial products, showcasing prudent resource management and cost-effective strategies in the execution of this endeavor.
