# Plan: Documentation
This phase involves outlining project goals, defining requirements, scheduling tasks, and creating a roadmap for the development process. It includes activities like brainstorming, scoping, prioritizing features, and setting timelines.

# Code: Python and Html
In this phase, developers write and review the actual code that implements the features or fixes identified issues. It involves utilizing version control systems, following coding best practices, and collaborating effectively within the development team.

# Build: Django
The code is compiled, integrated, and assembled into executable artifacts during the build phase. Continuous Integration (CI) practices are often employed to automate this process, ensuring that code changes are regularly and automatically merged, tested, and built.

# Test: Vercel
This phase focuses on validating the functionality, performance, security, and overall quality of the software. Various testing types, such as unit testing, integration testing, regression testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT), are conducted to identify and rectify any defects or issues.

# Release: Vercel and MongoDB
Once the code passes through the testing phase, it's prepared for deployment. The release phase involves finalizing the build, creating a deployable package, and ensuring that all necessary documentation, release notes, and configurations are in place for a successful deployment.

# Deploy: Vercel and MongoDB
This phase involves deploying the application or software to the target environment, which could be production, staging, or any other specified environment. Automated deployment pipelines or deployment scripts are often used to streamline and automate this process.

# Operate: Vercel
After deployment, the software is actively used by end-users. The operate phase involves managing and maintaining the application, handling user requests, monitoring performance, ensuring security, and providing ongoing support and maintenance.

# Monitor: Vercel
This phase involves continuous monitoring of the deployed application or system. It includes tracking performance metrics, analyzing logs, detecting anomalies, and ensuring that the application operates smoothly. Monitoring helps in identifying and resolving issues proactively to maintain the system's health and reliability.
