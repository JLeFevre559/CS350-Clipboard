### To add a simple tutorial page to an existing Django application, you'll generally need to modify or create a few key files in your Django project. Here's a general outline of the process and the files that you'll typically need to work with:

    ## Models (if needed):
        File: models.py
        Purpose: If your tutorial page requires storing or retrieving data from the database, you will need to define a model in models.py.

    ## URLs:
        File: urls.py
        Purpose: Define the URL pattern that will be used to access your tutorial page.

    ## Views:
        File: views.py
        Purpose: Create a view function or class that will render the tutorial page.

    ## Templates:
        File: Typically in a folder named templates
        Purpose: Create the HTML template for the tutorial page.

    ## Static Files (if needed):
        Folder: Typically a folder named static
        Purpose: Store any CSS, JavaScript, or images used by your tutorial page.
