# Artifact 1: Design

## Software Architecture

**ClipBoard**, our Trello-like project management tool, adopts a modular and scalable architecture leveraging Django's power, a high-level web framework. The architecture is built to ensure that each component is cohesive, maintainable, and can evolve as the system requirements change.

### Core Principles

- **Modularity**: By keeping our models, views, and tests distinct, we ensure that different parts of our application can evolve independently.
  
- **Scalability**: The use of Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) ensures that database operations are optimized, enabling the system to handle a growing number of projects and tasks efficiently.
  
- **Extensibility**: Our design leaves room for adding more features in the future. For instance, while we currently have a simple task status system, it can be expanded to incorporate more detailed workflows or integrations with third-party tools.

- **User-Centric Design**: A strong emphasis on user profiles, allowing for personalization, ensures that the user experience remains at the core of ClipBoard's evolution.

### Key Components

1. **Models (Data Layer)**: This forms the backbone of our application, representing the main entities and their relationships. Using Django's ORM capabilities, this abstracts the database interactions and provides a high-level, Pythonic interface to our data.

2. **Views (Presentation Layer)**: They define how data is presented to and interacted with by the users. By adhering to the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each data type, we ensure that users have a consistent and intuitive experience.

3. **Tests**: Integral for ensuring the reliability and robustness of our application. They allow us to catch and rectify issues early in the development lifecycle, ensuring that our application remains bug-free and performs optimally as it evolves.

### Deployment and Scalability

By building **ClipBoard** on these principles and components, we ensure a robust, user-friendly, and scalable project management tool ready to take on the challenges of modern collaborative environments.
