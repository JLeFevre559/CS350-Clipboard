## Milestone 2 - Test - Shane Loewe

* What did I do?
    * Learned about options for automated testing with tools like ChatGPT
    * Researched Checkly to see if the level of testing we need would be possible through the service
    * Setup automated tests through Checkly using the Playwrite framework
* What will I do?  Requirements for Milestone 3
    * For Milestone 3, I will try to analyze where our team is at currently in our project timeline, and
    * assess which features from the backlog should be implemented next. I will also help with data-modeling and
    * setting up our MongoDB database.
* What challenges do I have?
    * This will be the first time I've attacked data-modeling with some level of understanding on how a
    * database works. Given that MongoDB is a NoSQL database, it will be a little different than the 
    * relational databases I'm familiar with structuring. But I know a lot of data-modeling follows the
    * same concepts and that skills are pretty transferable across platforms.
* Engineering investment
    * Our team met in-class every Monday and Wednesday. There were also updates in our group-chat almost
    * everyday regarding changes we were making. I'd say for my own investment on this milestone, I probably put in
    * close to 5 hours of work.
* 5-minute Video Demo
