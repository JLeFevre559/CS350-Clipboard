# Milestone 2 - Test - Shane Loewe

Setup automated testing for the project by integrating Checkly.


## What I did for Milestone 2

I set up automated testing with the Playwrite framework for our site by integrating Checkly into our Vercel server.

## What I will do for Milestone 3
I will be in the Requirements role and will plan what our sprints will look like, along with doing some data-modeling for
our database.

## Concerns and Challenges
I think setting up the database is the Highest Order Concern right now. I forsee some work needing to go into implementing MongoDB
with our site. Although, I have some experience connecting Mongo to Python, so it shouldn't be too bad; but something that we
will undoubtedly spend a decent chunk of time on.
