# Clipboard - Milestone 6 - Feedback and Debug

use this feedback to enhance the web-based software app and release updates and improvements as
needed. We will also monitor the performance and usage of the app to identify any issues or areas
for improvement. The outcome of this milestone will be updates and improvements to the app based on
user feedback.
