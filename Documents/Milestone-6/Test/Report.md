## Milestone 6 - Test - Shane Loewe

* What did I do?
    * Added locustfile.py
    * Installed Locust Load testing
    * Switched Python Interpreter
    * Cleared Import Errors
    * Implemented simple locust tests for further expansion
    * Added soak test
    * Added load test

* What will I do? 
    * I would like to add more complex tests to the locust file. I wish we had discovered the swarming tool sooner
    * Make

* What challenges do I have?
    * I tried implementing some tests that would stress-test inputting data into a mock database, but I couldn't get the
    * 'post' command to work the way I wanted it to. Further development will be required to utilize this tool to 
    * its fullest potential

* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 16 hours on Test for Milestone 6
    * Our team met for 4 hours

* 5-minute Video Demo
