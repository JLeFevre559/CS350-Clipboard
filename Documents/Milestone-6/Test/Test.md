## Milestone 6 - Test - Shane Loewe

# Added locustfile.py

    I created the locustfile.py where future locust tests can go
# Installed Locust Load testing

    I used pip to install the most current locust load testing tool
# Switched Python Interpreter

    I reverted to an earlier python interpreter, which was more of a personal
    issue, but one that needed fixing for a while. I was having consistent
    issues importing certain modules.

# Cleared Import Errors

    Related to the previous task, but I cleared several import errors I was having.

# Implemented simple locust tests for further expansion

    Used the locust .get command to load webpages, proving the site can handle being loaded
    by many users at a time. I tested to numbers as high as 10,000 simultaneous users. 

# Added soak test

    Made an option for constant swarm of users to the site

# Added load test

    Made an option for swarm of users to the site at varied times between 1 and 5 seconds.
