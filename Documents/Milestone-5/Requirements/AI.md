# Can you write some simple tasks for a user in a usability test for this program?

## Usability Test for the Web-Based Project Management Tool

### Login and Navigation
- **Login to the application.**
- **Navigate to the homepage** after logging in.
- **Identify the section** where your projects are listed.

### Project Management
- **Create a new project.** Fill in the necessary details and save.
- **Go to the list of projects** and find the one you just created.
- **Edit the details** of the project you just created.
- **Navigate to the detail page** of the project.
- **Delete the project** you created.

### Task List Creation
- **From a project's detail page, create a new task list.** Provide the required details.
- **After creation, verify** if the task list appears on the project's detail page.

### Task Management
- **From a task list, add a new task** with the given details: task name, description, due date, and priority.
- **Update the status** of the task you just created.
- **Edit the task's details** like changing its name or due date.
- **Delete the task** you just created.

### Profile Color Generation (Signup)
- **Sign up for a new account.**
- **Once signed up and logged in, check your profile color** (assuming it's visible somewhere in the UI).
- **Log out and then log in again** to ensure your profile and its color are persistent.

### Calendar View
- **Navigate to the Calendar view.**
  - (If any additional functionalities are available in the Calendar view, interact with them. For example, check if tasks or projects are displayed.)

### Error Handling and Validation
- **Try creating a project without filling in any details.** Check if the system gives a validation error.
- **Try to create a task without a due date or priority.** Again, check for validation errors.
- **Navigate to the delete functionality** for a project or task. Cancel the deletion when prompted. Ensure the item is not deleted.

### AJAX Functionalities
- **Change the status of a task** and check if the update is instant (without a full page reload).
- **Delete a task list using AJAX** and verify it's removed instantly.
- **Update a task list name using AJAX** and verify the name change is reflected immediately.

**Note:** During the usability test, it's essential to observe the user's behavior, their confusion or hesitation, and any feedback they provide. The aim is to identify areas of improvement in the UI/UX. It's also crucial to ensure that the tasks are clear and the test environment is set up correctly (e.g., having a test database, ensuring the server is running smoothly, etc.).
