# Milestone 5 - Test - Joel LeFevre

# Reorganized test code

    * I split our test code into separate test files to increase readability

# Added test files for local and live URLS

    * I noticed that we didn't have strong tests for our URLS and HTML, so I added files where we could expand upon those tests
    * I moved some of my team's existing URL tests into these files so they will run when we do python manage.py test

# I closed an issue: 

# I closed an issue: 

# I improved the styling of the project details page

# I ran coverage.py, and generated an html report which gave me a table with the current coverage of our code

    * I added up the test lines to calculate our current test coverage
    * I looked through the items that were not at 100% and started to add tests to cover those items

# I ran coverage.py at the end of milestone

    * I compared the data given to me at this point to the data that I got at the beginning of the milestone (((FUTURE)))
