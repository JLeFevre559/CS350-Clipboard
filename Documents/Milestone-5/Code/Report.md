## Milestone 5 - Code - Shane Loewe

* What did I do?
    * I added a way for a user to edit their profile.
    * Fixed the edit-profile functionality, as there were some major problems with it initially.
    * I worked with Joel in Testing to figure out how to make tests for the edit profile functionality, which was super helpful.
    * I added some visual consistency by ensuring a user's profile icon always had capital letters.
    * I utilized ChatGPT to figure out the edit profile functionality. 

* What will I do? 
    * For Milestone 6 I will be in the testing seat, so I will be going through all of our tests and trying to refactor them where I can, but ultimately just checking to see that they all work, as well as add tests that don't exist.
    * I will try to stress-test our website by creating extreme tests with either fringe cases or potential threats
    * I will look into reducing runtime on our tests

* What challenges do I have?
    * No real concerns right now! Milestone 5 wrapped up a lot of the stuff we've been working on.

* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 20 hours on Code for Milestone 5
    * Our team met for 4 hours

* 5-minute Video Demo
