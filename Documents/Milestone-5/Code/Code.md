# Milestone 5 - Code - Shane Loewe



## What I did for Milestone 5

### Wrapped up final features

* Our team finished up adding the final features for the minimum viable product this milestone.

### Pushed some goals back to "Phase 2"

* Our team decided that collaborators and assignees can wait until the next phase, after our initial release.

### Added Profile editting capabilities

* I spent much of my time working on adding functionality to the "Edit Profile" button.

### Tests for Profile Editing

* I added a test in our test pages for testing whether the edit profile function works.
* Unfortunately, this was after I accidentally set many fields in our database to "Null"

### Capitalized User Icon Letters

* I made sure that the letters in a user's Icon will always be capitalized. 

### Status Video 

I created a summary of the test and deployment work completed.  View the video at https://youtu.be/dkwaIupXSPw


## What I will do for Milestone 6

* For Milestone 6 I will be in the testing role, so I will be looking to make sure all of our tests are functional
* I might STRESS-test the website. That could be fun, and maybe revealing of mass underlying issues if we have any.
* I will look into reducing runtime on our tests

## Concerns and Challenges

* No real concerns right now! Milestone 5 wrapped up a lot of the stuff we've been working on.
