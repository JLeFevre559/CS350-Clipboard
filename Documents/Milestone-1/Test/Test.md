# Milestone 1 - Test 

Setup the initial web hosting for the project.


## What I did for Milestone 1

### Web Hosting

I selected Vercel for hosting our app using Django as our framework.


### Status Video 

I created a summary of the test and deployment work completed.  View the video at 
** VIDEO NOT CREATED YET **


## What I will do for Milestone 2

I am not sure what role I will be for milestone 2, but if I were to still be the testing role I would ***develop a comprehensive test plan (including Web Testing, System Testing, Unit Testing)*** This needs to be changed after you can see what the expectations are on the website again


## Concerns and Challenges

Need to do Git Pull and Git Push on server.

Need to set up new database for production.
