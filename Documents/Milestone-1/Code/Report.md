## Milestone 1 - Code - Shane Loewe

* What did I do?
    * I set up the documentation provided by Mark Seaman in our Git Repo by downloading and importing the Milestone-1 folder from his GitHub
    * Although the repo is under Joel's name given the nature of Vercel and how they set-up projects for you, I organized and rearranged the Project files and structure from the Vercel default as detailed below.
        * Documents - project documentation
        * Application - source code for the Clipboard app
    * Experiment with AI (ChatGPT) for coding
* What will I do?  Code for Milestone 2
    * Create initial prototype for pages laid out by Requirements and Design Team 
    * Work with team on design and scalable code 
    * Demonstrate the core feature of Clipboard: Interactive and responsive Cards in flexboxes
* What challenges do I have?
    * No challenges outstanding
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 2 or 3 hours on Code for Milestone 1
    * Our team met for 3 or 4 hours in class 
* 5-minute Video Demo
