# Application Project

Throughout this course, you will build a medium-sized application with the following guidelines:

- Patterned after a popular web-based application
- Build software with a team of four people
- Deliver code on a fixed schedule with 7 milestones
- Each milestone, every member will be assigned a unique role (requirements, design, code, test) that rotates

## Milestone 1: Project Charter

In this milestone, the team will:
- Work together to identify the app requirements.
- Work with stakeholders to gather and analyze requirements for the web-based software app.
- Create a detailed requirements document outlining the app's scope, features, and functionality.

## Milestone 2: Software Design and Architecture

In this milestone, we will:
- Design the architecture and user interface of the web-based software app.
- Create a detailed software design document, including the high-level architecture, UI design, and technology stack.
- Begin an early version of the application hosting.

## Milestone 3: Implementation and Coding

In this milestone, the team will:
- Collaborate to code the app.
- Develop a functional prototype of the web-based software app using an agile development approach.
- Build the minimum viable product (MVP) that includes the core features and functionality.
- Produce a fully functional app with all core features implemented.

## Milestone 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

In this milestone, we will:
- Test the web-based software app ensuring it meets the requirements document specifications.
- Use automated testing tools and manual testing for verification.
- Identify and rectify any defects or issues that arise during testing.
- Ensure 50% of all code written is test code and achieve a code coverage over 95%.

## Milestone 5: Deployment and Release Management

In this milestone, we will:
- Integrate the web-based software app with third-party services or APIs.
- Deploy it to a production environment using CI/CD tools.
- Ensure the app is available to users with the outcome being a live app accessible to them.

## Milestone 6: User Feedback and Enhancement

In this milestone, we will:
- Collect user feedback and identify enhancement areas.
- Update and improve the web-based software app based on this feedback.
- Monitor the app's performance and usage, identifying and addressing any issues.

## Milestone 7: Project Closeout

In this milestone, we will:
- Conduct a project review and analyze performance.
- Document lessons learned and draft a final report.
- Celebrate successes and pinpoint areas for future project improvements.
