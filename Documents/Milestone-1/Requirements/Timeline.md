# ClipBoard Application Project

Throughout this course, we aim to develop `ClipBoard`, a project management tool patterned after popular web-based applications. The project guidelines are:

- Built collaboratively by a team of four members.
- Delivered in a fixed schedule spanning 7 milestones.
- In each milestone, every team member rotates through a unique role (requirements, design, code, test).

## Milestone 1: Project Charter

In this milestone, the team will:
- Collaborate to identify the specific requirements for `ClipBoard`.
- Engage with potential users and stakeholders to gather and analyze detailed requirements.
- Produce a comprehensive requirements document, pinpointing `ClipBoard`'s scope, features, and desired functionalities.

## Milestone 2: Software Design and Architecture

For `ClipBoard`, this milestone involves:
- Crafting a unique architecture and user interface tailored to our user's needs.
- Compiling a detailed software design document, which elaborates on the high-level architecture, UI/UX designs, and the chosen technology stack.
- Initiating the hosting framework for `ClipBoard`.

## Milestone 3: Implementation and Coding

In this crucial phase, the team will:
- Dive into coding `ClipBoard`.
- Deploy an agile development approach to create a functional prototype.
- Develop the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) emphasizing `ClipBoard`'s core features.
- Present a fully operational version of `ClipBoard` with all integral features in place.

## Milestone 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

For ensuring the robustness of `ClipBoard`, this milestone covers:
- Comprehensive testing against the detailed requirements.
- Utilizing automated tools alongside manual testing procedures to ensure optimal user experiences.
- Addressing and rectifying any discrepancies or issues discovered.
- Ensuring that at least 50% of all written code is dedicated to testing, aiming for a code coverage exceeding 95%.

## Milestone 5: Deployment and Release Management

As `ClipBoard` takes shape, this milestone emphasizes:
- Seamless integration with any third-party tools or APIs that enhance `ClipBoard`'s functionality.
- Transitioning to a production environment using streamlined CI/CD methodologies.
- Making `ClipBoard` accessible and user-ready.

## Milestone 6: User Feedback and Enhancement

In response to real-world usage, this milestone involves:
- Actively collecting feedback from `ClipBoard` users.
- Implementing updates and refinements based on this invaluable feedback.
- Monitoring `ClipBoard`'s performance metrics and addressing any emerging concerns or areas ripe for enhancement.

## Milestone 7: Project Closeout

As we wrap up, this milestone sees the team:
- Engaging in a comprehensive review of the `ClipBoard` project.
- Documenting insights and lessons gathered throughout the development journey.
- Celebrating the successful creation of `ClipBoard` while brainstorming areas for potential future refinements.
