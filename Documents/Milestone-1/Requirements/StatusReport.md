## What I did for Milestone 1

1. **Requirement Gathering**: 

The requirements of the ClipBoard application were defined by the needs of potential users who require a streamlined and intuitive task management system. The results of the Requirement Gathering are documented in the [ClipBoard - Product Features](ClipBoard-ProductFeatures.md).

2. **Prioritization and Scope Definition**: 

The product features support the goals of users who want an organized system to manage tasks and projects. The project scope, priorities, and feature set are all documented in the [ClipBoard - Product Features](ClipBoard-ProductFeatures.md).

3. **Stakeholder Review and Approval**: 

Since the start of this project, I've been reviewing the features and project plans with individuals who could be potential users of ClipBoard. I plan on continuing this review process and will allow feedback to shape the development throughout the entirety of the project.

I also aim to produce a video at every development stage to explain how the system functions. This might spark additional feedback and foster interest in the project.


5. **Status Video**: 

I compiled a summary of the finished requirements work. View the video at [Milestone 1 - Requirements](Video.md).

## What I will do for Milestone 2

- Plan out 3 phases of implementation (core features, full features, bonus features).
- Establish team project communication and planning.
- Revise product requirements.

## Concerns and Challenges

I have reservations about how to integrate specific features and functions into ClipBoard.
