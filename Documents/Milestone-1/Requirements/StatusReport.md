## What I did for Milestone 1

1. **Requirement Gathering**: 

The requirements of the ClipBoard application were defined by the needs of potential users who require a streamlined and intuitive task management system. The results of the Requirement Gathering are documented in the [ClipBoard - Product Features](ClipBoard-ProductFeatures.md).

2. **Prioritization and Scope Definition**: 

The product features support the goals of users who want an organized system to manage tasks and projects. The project scope, priorities, and feature set are all documented in the [ClipBoard - Product Features](ClipBoard-ProductFeatures.md).

3. **Stakeholder Review and Approval**: 

Since the start of this project, I've been reviewing the features and project plans with individuals who could be potential users of ClipBoard. I plan on continuing this review process and will allow feedback to shape the development throughout the entirety of the project.

I also aim to produce a video at every development stage to explain how the system functions. This might spark additional feedback and foster interest in the project.

4. **Milestone Review**: 

Given that this project is not being conducted for external stakeholders, there's no formal milestone review meeting or presentation. However, in a conventional project setting, this step is essential for a thorough assessment of completed tasks, progress, and stakeholder satisfaction. It offers an opportunity to address any potential concerns or discrepancies before proceeding, ensuring that the project stays on track and adheres to the initial requirements.

5. **Status Video**: 

I compiled a summary of the finished requirements work. View the video at [Milestone 1 - Requirements](Video.md).

## What I will do for Milestone 2

- Plan out 3 phases of implementation (core features, full features, bonus features).
- Establish team project communication and planning.
- Revise product requirements.

## Concerns and Challenges

I have reservations about how to integrate specific features and functions into ClipBoard.
