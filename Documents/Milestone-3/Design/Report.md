## Milestone 3 - Requirements - Joel LeFevre

* What did I do?
    * I used ChatGPT to flesh out the data models that we would need for our project
    * I used ChatGPT to turn that list of models into a relational database graph using DBML, then used a DBML visualization tool to identify if anything was missing or unnecessary
    * I updated our Profile model to use the built in Django model for users
        * I also updated our Profile model to use a UUID instead of an incremented int id
    * I fixed an issue with django not being able to find models.py
    * I used my previous work on the visualization to update our models, and had ChatGPT make an updated DBML of our models
    
* What will I do?  Test for Milestone 2
