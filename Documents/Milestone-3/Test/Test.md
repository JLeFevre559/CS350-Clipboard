# Milestone 3 - Test - Alexander Hart

Test-Driven Development Workflow: Test stuff by making some tests

## What I did for Milestone 3

* I created a Model test for testing models
* I created a View test for testing views
* I created a mm command for faster development
* I created a SuperTest for a one stop command for running all of the tests at the same time.

### Web Framework and Language

* Front End – Django
* Back End – Python
* Data – Mongo DB
* Hosting – Vercel
* Source Control - Git
* Coding environment - VS Code 

### Status Video 

I've generated a synopsis of the finished Test tasks. Watch the video here: https://youtu.be/82AtojYo4P0

## What I will do for Milestone 4

Work to coordinate with the team to ensure that we are all on the same page in terms of progress, might help with the codding of views.

## Concerns and Challenges

I'm a bit concerned about the scale of the project and how far we will be able to go, as we get stuff done. remedied as of (9/25/2023) thanks to the lecture, thanks!
