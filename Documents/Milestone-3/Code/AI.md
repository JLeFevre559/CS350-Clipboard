how would I make a test uding djangos built in testing framework>

Creating tests in Django using its built-in testing framework is straightforward and robust. Here's a step-by-step guideline on how to create a simple test:

Create a tests.py file:

If it doesn't already exist, create a tests.py file in your app directory where you want to write tests.
Import necessary modules:

python
Copy code
from django.test import TestCase
from .models import YourModel  # Replace 'YourModel' with the name of your model
Create a test case class:

Create a class for your test case, inheriting from TestCase.
python
Copy code
class YourModelTestCase(TestCase):
    ...
Set up data for testing:

You can set up any necessary data for your tests in the setUp method.
python
Copy code
class YourModelTestCase(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        YourModel.objects.create(name="Test Name")
Write test methods:

Write methods for each aspect of your app you want to test. Test method names must begin with test_.
python
Copy code
class YourModelTestCase(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        YourModel.objects.create(name="Test Name")

    def test_model_name(self):
        instance = YourModel.objects.get(id=1)
        expected_name = f'{instance.name}'
        self.assertEqual(expected_name, 'Test Name')
Run your tests:

Use the manage.py file to run your tests from the command line.
bash
Copy code
python manage.py test your_app_name
In this simple example, we've created a test case class YourModelTestCase with a single test method test_model_name. This test method retrieves the YourModel instance we created in the setUp method and checks if its name is 'Test Name' using the assertEqual method from TestCase.
