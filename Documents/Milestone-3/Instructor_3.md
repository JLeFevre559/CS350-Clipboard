# Clipboard - Milestone 3 - Implementation and Coding

In this milestone, the team will work together to write the code for the app. We will develop a
functional prototype of the web-based software app. We will use an agile development approach and
build the minimum viable product (MVP) that includes the core features and functionality. The
outcome of this milestone will be a fully functional app with all the core features and
functionality implemented.
