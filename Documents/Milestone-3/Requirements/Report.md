* **Project Priorities**
    1. Project and Task Creation 
    2. Users/Login
    3. Best Practices
  
* **What will I do? Requirements for Milestone 4**
    * I will be in the design role for Milestone 4. I really want to formalize how our 
    database is going to store user information. I imagine this will take a lot of collaboration 
    with the Code role. I think we're at a point in the project too where a Design role should
    start thinking more deeply about UX, and how we're going to design the layout of our application, 
    so I intend on doing some UX Design testing.

* **What challenges do I have?**
    * I think trying to stay on top of task dependencies was the hardest part of his role. 
    Trying to coordinate what task needs to be done by when entailed a lot of: "What task 
    needs to be done IN ORDER for this task to be done."
  
* **Engineering investment**
    * I dedicated approximately 6 hours to the Requirements for Milestone 3
    * Team meetings totaled 4 hours 
  
* **5-minute Video Demo**
